They seem bound for totally different futures – the bookish Yu Xi Gu looks destined for academic success, while life is just a long popularity contest for Xiang Hao Ting. But a quirk of fate – and a crucial intervention by a female schoolmate – results in the two young men’s paths crossing.

But there is more to both young men than first meets the eye. Xiang Hao Ting was not always this way. He started out as a perfect student until he discovered the joys of going off the rails.

And Yu Xi Gu has a reason for being so aloof and studious: His parents died in a traffic accident while he was younger, and he is being fostered by his aunt. As such, he works hard to get good grades in an effort to win a scholarship and ease the financial burden on his relatives.

Yu Xi Gu also works part-time at a convenience store, where his manager Liu Zhi Gang (Zhang Han Yuan) has developed a crush on a man he has met at the gym.

Back at school, meanwhile, Yu Xi Gu and Xiang Hao Ting find themselves drawn together, and passions ignite. The former notices that he has the unique ability to bring Xiang Hao Ting out of his shell – and becomes intent on melting his cold-as-ice exterior.

Growing up without his parents, Zi Ming was raised by one of his mother’s sisters, which always seems to make relating to his peers a bit difficult. The same could be said for Cheng Yi (Hu Shi Wen) who, without parents, was raised by his grandmother. Which is probably why the two boys found it so easy to bond. Sharing the struggles of growing up without a traditional family, it didn’t take long for the two boys to become fast friends.

As the boys grew, their friendship grew with it, but only to a point. Struggling through those difficult adolescent years, Zi Ming and Cheng Yi’s friendship was put to the test when their mutual friends Lu Xiang Lin (Yu Le Xin) and Yue Yu Zhi (Meng Yue Chen) entered the picture. Jealous of Zi Ming and Cheng Yi’s friendship, Xiang Lin and Yu Zhi were often mean and more than a little vindictive. Struggling to understand their own relationship while simultaneously trying to figure out their relationships with others, Zi Ming and Cheng Yi often find themselves caught up in a tidal wave of conflicting emotions. Some days they love each other and other days they can’t stand each other. 

Trying desperately to hold onto a friendship that has gotten them through so much, Zi Ming and Cheng Yi come to find that the harder they try to hold onto each other, the farther apart they seem to drift. Will they ever find a way to save their lifelong relationship?

However, he is famously hard to please, aloof, and fiercely critical – meaning wine importers and restaurant owners live in fear of his disdain.

One day, Lu Wei Xun’s world is turned upside down – after he accidentally kisses a woman named He Bu Zui (Song Yi Ren).
 
In almost every way possible, He Bu Zui is his polar opposite: She is down-to-earth, warm-hearted, and approachable. And most importantly, she lost sensation in her tastebuds at a very young age, meaning no matter what she eats or drinks, she cannot taste a thing!

Worse still, their fleeting kiss has a magical side-effect: He Bu Zui gains the wine critic’s highly developed sense of taste, while Lu Wei Xun suddenly cannot taste anything he eats or drinks – stripping him of his wine tasting super-abilities.

A successful designer at Morita Design, Akiha literally has her dream job, has a great working relationship with her colleagues, and is just as happy in her personal life as she is her professional one. Having endured a number of bad relationships in the past, Akiha has come to the conclusion that the single life is best, especially when she has so many friends who love and support her. The only problem is that her grandmother is constantly hounding her to get married. 

Despite her grandmother’s wishes, Akiha is happiest on her own and is in absolutely no rush to get married. Which is why she has no qualms about rejecting Shu Momose’s (Kentaro Sakaguchi) proposal, when he offers her his hand in marriage. A diligent, reliable man, with a good job and good looks, Shu has a lot to offer a woman, but his sudden proposal to Akiha at a drinking party is nothing short of ridiculous. With his own reasons for wanting to marry, Shu sees Akiha as a means to an end, and sees no reason why he should waste any more time searching for someone else. Despite her initial rejection, Akiha finds herself reconsidering Shu’s proposal when he agrees to pay her five million yen in exchange for her hand. Knowing the money will completely change her grandmother’s life, Akiha finds herself unable to say no. 

Now a registered married couple, Akiha and Shu find adjusting to married life is a bit more challenging than either imagined, especially when their initial feelings of indifference slowly begin to morph into something wholly unexpected. Could it be that their fake marriage is actually the path they needed to take to find true love?

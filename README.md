# Overview


- ## Purpose
  Viki is one of Asia's biggest movie websites, with millions of reviews about different movies and shows. VK holds valuable insights and trends in movie ratings, user reviews, and demographic information by scraping VK and comparing it with MDL and DB, the world's most popular foreign drama website. By systematically comparing DB, MDL, and VK data, a comprehensive and global perspective on audience preferences, cultural influences, and viewing habits can be derived. This comparative analysis enriches our understanding of the entertainment landscape and sheds light on the cross-cultural dynamics shaping the reception of movies and shows.
